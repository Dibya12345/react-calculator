## Customization 

You can customize the calculator's appearance or add additional functionality by modifying the CSS styles and extending the calculator component. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to suit your requirements.

## Notes 
- This calculator uses the eval() function to evaluate the input expression. However, using eval() can be a security risk if user input is not properly validated and sanitized. In a production environment, it's important to implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques.
- The calculator's design is inspired by the style of an iPhone calculator. The styling can be further enhanced or modified based on your preferences by updating the CSS.
